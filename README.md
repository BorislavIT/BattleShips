# Kursova-Rabota-1
# Instructions in order to start the project:
1. You must have visual studio and c++ installed on your computer.
2. Download the zip file.
3. Open ConsoleApplication2.vcxproj, if you open Battleships.sin the project won't load for some reason.
4. Open up the BattleShips.c file in visual studio.
5. Hit ctrl + f5 or go click debug - start without debugging.
6. Follow instructions given from the console.
7. Have fun and hit me up with your thoughts!

It's my first C decently sized project, nothing special really, just figuring out how it all works =).
